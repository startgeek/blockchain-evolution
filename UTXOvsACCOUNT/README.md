### Understanding Bitcoin vs Ethereum Balance Management in Rust

so the aim here is that we learn everything by code. so actually we are learning rust languae. design patterns on the side while we try to keep understang concepts in blockchain.  

so just read the code (its a mock) get the concept after you made sure EVERYTHIN is synched in completely I give you a prize

PRIZE:


Rare Satoshis and Rune Indexing in UTXO

The UTXO model in Bitcoin enables the concept of rare satoshis and indexing systems like Runes. Since each transaction output is uniquely identifiable and independently verifiable, it allows individual satoshis to be tracked and categorized based on their history, transaction metadata, or even inclusion in specific mined blocks. This uniqueness makes it possible to ascribe special properties to certain satoshis, facilitating digital collectibles, ordinal inscriptions, and alternative tokenization layers within Bitcoin's existing framework. Unlike Ethereum's account-based model, which treats balances as a single numerical value without inherent differentiation, UTXOs provide an inherent way to distinguish and track specific units of Bitcoin.
